# Sudoku-Solver-Constrained
Solve n^2 x n^2 Constrained set of Sudoku in O(N^3) time!!


Take a Sudoku Puzzle Generated by my algorithm.
Instructions will be created for solving Judgment Day Sudokus(yeah I know I made up a name) but these sudokus are so large (eg. 50x25 ---> 1000 x 1000). That the only way to solve them is to abide by input rules r. Next week I'll share part two for larger grid solving rules for the poly-time solver.
